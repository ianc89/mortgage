This is a simple mortgage repayment calculator

## Usage
To add different interest rates and repayment amounts, create new `interest_rate` objects which are attached to the mortgage object. Ensure the months align otherwise an error will be generated.

With the given attached rates, you can also run a repayment calculator which will overwrite your default monthly repayment with a new fixed value. This can show how much quicker you should be able to repay your mortgage. Keep in mind there may be overpayment restrictions.
